            <p>
              I have just finished a front-end developer online course at
              <a href="https://pixellab.ro/cursuri/front-end-web-development"
                >Pixellab</a
              >
              and now I feel more than ready to dive into this field and give it
              my all to become better as a front-end developer. I have studied
              the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript and what I need now is the
              real-world experiece in coding, that this internship will provide.
              I have also started another course in learning React which will
              help me grow more as a developer.I am currently working in an unrelated 
              field which leans strongly on soft skills, sure to come in handy in all types of 
              work. These include transferrable skills such as engaging easily with people from 
              different backgrounds, working in a diverse team, and a great deal of patience under 
              pressure. This internship experience is interesting because it would offer me the 
              opportunity to gain practical skills in the field. I'm eager to apply the theories 
              studied at the course, and to work alongside professionals in the domain, 
              learning more about the business along the way.
              I would appreciate an opportunity to talk further about my application, 
              and am easiest to reach via email or phone.Thank you
              in advance for reviewing my application and considering how I
              might contribute to your team. <br><br>
              Sincerely, Monica
