            <p>
              I have just finished a front-end developer online course at
              <a href="https://pixellab.ro/cursuri/front-end-web-development"
                >Pixellab</a
              >
              and now I feel more than ready to dive into this field and give it
              my all to become better as a front-end developer. I have studied
              the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript and what I need now is the
              real-world experience in coding, that this internship will provide.
              I have also started another course in learning React which will
              help me grow more as a developer.
            </p>
            <p>
              Currently, I am working in an unrelated field which leans strongly
              on soft skills, sure to come in handy in all types of work. These
              include transferrable skills such as engaging easily with people
              from different backgrounds, working in a diverse team, and a great
              deal of patience under pressure.
            </p>
            <p>
              I want to enter an internship in fron-end development because it
              would offer me the opportunity to gain practical skills in the
              field. I'm eager to apply the theories studied at the course, and
              to work alongside professionals in the domain, learning more about
              the business along the way.
            </p>
            <p>
              I would appreciate an opportunity to talk further about my
              application, and am easiest to reach via email or phone. Thank you
              in advance for reviewing my application and considering how I
              might contribute to your team.
